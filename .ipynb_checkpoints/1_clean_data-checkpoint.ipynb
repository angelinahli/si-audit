    "### Purpose\n",
    "* Evaluate the accuracy of the figures in this study\n",
    "* Evaluate the methodology for reasonableness\n",
    "* Evaluate whether the conclusions of this study match the data\n",
    "* Consider whether this dataset is useful for further research purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "* Population: US Adults\n",
    "* Sample: 1,094 people, census-balanced based on age, sex, region, ethnicity, and income.\n",
    "    * *Note: which census? How does Ipsos do census-balancing?*\n",
    "    * Excludes individuals who failed the awareness check - 46.3% of people passed.\n",
    "        * I wonder whether selecting based on attention biases the results?\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Main Findings\n",
    "1. **54%** of US adults say they are “currently trying to **consume fewer animal-based foods** (meat, dairy, and/or eggs) **and more plant-based foods** (fruits, grains, beans, and/or vegetables).”\n",
    "2. **97%** of US adults agree “Whether to eat animals or be vegetarian is a **personal choice**, and nobody has the right to tell me which one they think I should do.”\n",
    "3. **49%** of US adults support a **ban on factory farming**\n",
    "4. **47%** support a **ban on slaughterhouses**\n",
    "5. **33%** support a **ban on animal farming**\n",
    "6. **58%** of US adults think “most farmed animals are **treated well**”\n",
    "7. **75%** of US adults say they usually buy animal products “**from animals that are treated humanely**”"
